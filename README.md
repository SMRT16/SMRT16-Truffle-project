The idea of Decentralized Unmanaged Organization is about that there are some businesses possible which operate completely on-chain and make profit absolutely without any external management.

It has all the required minimum to have a fully operational decentralized company.


The big thing about SMRT16 is decentralization of marketing which is built in the token sale.

Unlike other projects, SMRT16 does not need to raise any funds for its development.

The funds from the token sale are instantly paid back to the project participants as marketing bonuses.

The goal of the project is to raise the people's attention which later will be monetized for the long lasting profit again back for investors of the project.

Token sale has a multi level referral program, which is that decentralized marketing mentioned above.

It works the following way: every project participant has his own "PersonalSMRT16" Smart Contract address, which was created for him during the first token purchase.

With this address the user becomes an agent of the project and now he can invite other people to buy SMRT16 tokens by paying ETH to his personal address.

In this case the agent gets a referral commission or marketing bonus from unlimited sale transaction done by him him through his Personal SMRT16 address or by his referrals.

There are four levels of referrals bonuses. General rule is that, E]every next level of referrals bonus has the half the amount of bonuses of the previous level, so:

 - 1st level referral reward is 50%   or 1/2  of the transaction.
 - 2nd level referral reward is 25%   or 1/4  of the transaction.
 - 3rd level referral reward is 12.5% or 1/8  of the transaction.
 - 4th level referral reward is 6.25% or 1/16 of the transaction.


> Note: everything paid in ETH instantly.

All together it makes that 15/16 of the token price are spent to pay for the marketing efforts of the project investors.

The remaining 1/16 of the token price, together with any other incomes goes to "Profit Accumulator SMRT16" address and paid out as dividends at the end of every month.

What after the token sale the project is going to make money with a number of coming soon Smart contracts. Which are supposed to get traffic by the efforts of all the big number of investors involved during the token sale and referral marketing campaign.
